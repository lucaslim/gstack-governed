## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch, and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** \`RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]\`
4. **Options:** Lettered options: \`A) ... B) ... C) ...\`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Serena Code Navigation (optional, reduces token usage)

If Serena MCP tools are available (`mcp__serena__*`), prefer them for code lookup tasks.
They provide symbol-level precision that avoids reading entire files.

**Activation (run once at start):**
Try `mcp__serena__activate_project` with the repo root path. If it succeeds, Serena
is active. If it fails or the tool is unavailable, skip all Serena tools and use
Grep + Read instead.

**If activation succeeds but symbol lookups return empty results:** Run
`mcp__serena__onboarding` once — Serena needs a one-time index build per project.

**When Serena is active, prefer these patterns:**

| Task | Without Serena | With Serena |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Understand file structure | Read the whole file | `get_symbols_overview` (~90% fewer tokens) |
| Find where a symbol is used | Grep for name → Read each file | `find_referencing_symbols` (returns snippets only) |
| Read a specific function | Read the whole file | `find_symbol` with `include_body=true` |
| Search for a pattern | Grep | `search_for_pattern` (equivalent) |

**Fallback rule:** If any Serena tool call fails, fall back to Grep + Read for that
operation. Do not retry — switch immediately.

## Step 0: Detect base branch

Determine which branch this PR targets. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch:
   `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`
   If this succeeds, use the printed branch name as the base branch.

2. If no PR exists (command fails), detect the repo's default branch:
   `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`

3. If both commands fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and `gh pr create` command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch."

# Ship: Fully Automated Ship Workflow

You are running the `/ship` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated** workflow. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/ship` which means DO IT. Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the base branch (abort)
- Rebase conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (abort rebase, stop, show conflicts)
- Test failures (stop, show failures)
- Pre-landing review finds ASK items that need user judgment

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- Multi-file changesets (auto-split into bisectable commits)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)
- Test coverage gaps (auto-generate and commit, or flag in PR body)

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch or the repo's default branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

4. Check review readiness:

## Review Readiness Dashboard

After completing the review, read the review log and config to display the dashboard.

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
cat ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_REVIEWS"
echo "---CONFIG---"
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get skip_eng_review 2>/dev/null || echo "false"
```

Parse the output. Find the most recent entry for each skill (plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, plan-design-review). Ignore entries with timestamps older than 7 days. Display:

```
+====================================================================+
|                    REVIEW READINESS DASHBOARD                       |
+====================================================================+
| Review          | Runs | Last Run            | Status    | Required |
|-----------------|------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| Eng Review      |  1   | 2026-03-16 15:00    | CLEAR     | YES      |
| CEO Review      |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
| Design Review   |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VERDICT: CLEARED — Eng Review passed                                |
+====================================================================+
```

**Review tiers:**
- **Eng Review (required by default):** The only review that gates shipping. Covers architecture, code quality, tests, performance. Can be disabled globally with \`gstack-config set skip_eng_review true\` (the "don't bother me" setting).
- **CEO Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for big product/business changes, new user-facing features, or scope decisions. Skip for bug fixes, refactors, infra, and cleanup.
- **Design Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for UI/UX changes. Skip for backend-only, infra, or prompt-only changes.

**Verdict logic:**
- **CLEARED**: Eng Review has >= 1 entry within 7 days with status "clean" (or \`skip_eng_review\` is \`true\`)
- **NOT CLEARED**: Eng Review missing, stale (>7 days), or has open issues
- CEO and Design reviews are shown for context but never block shipping
- If \`skip_eng_review\` config is \`true\`, Eng Review shows "SKIPPED (global)" and verdict is CLEARED

If the Eng Review is NOT "CLEAR":

1. **Check for a prior override on this branch:**
   ```bash
   eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
   grep '"skill":"ship-review-override"' ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_OVERRIDE"
   ```
   If an override exists, display the dashboard and note "Review gate previously accepted — continuing." Do NOT ask again.

2. **If no override exists,** use AskUserQuestion:
   - Show that Eng Review is missing or has open issues
   - RECOMMENDATION: Choose C if the change is obviously trivial (< 20 lines, typo fix, config-only); Choose B for larger changes
   - Options: A) Ship anyway  B) Abort — run /plan-eng-review first  C) Change is too small to need eng review
   - If CEO/Design reviews are missing, mention them as informational ("CEO Review not run — recommended for product changes") but do NOT block or recommend aborting for them

3. **If the user chooses A or C,** persist the decision so future `/ship` runs on this branch skip the gate:
   ```bash
   eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)
   echo '{"skill":"ship-review-override","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","decision":"USER_CHOICE"}' >> ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl
   ```
   Substitute USER_CHOICE with "ship_anyway" or "not_relevant".

---

## Step 2: Rebase onto the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Fetch and rebase the feature branch onto the base branch so tests run against the rebased state:

```bash
git fetch origin <base> && git rebase origin/<base>
```

**If there are rebase conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve if they are simple (lock files, config file ordering). If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, run `git rebase --abort` to restore the original branch state, **STOP**, and show the conflicts.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

---

## Step 2.5: Test Framework Bootstrap

## Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .local-context/no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Use AskUserQuestion:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write `.local-context/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Use AskUserQuestion:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → write `.local-context/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.local-context/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit --no-verify -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

---

## Step 3: Run tests (on merged code)

Run the project's test/lint/typecheck commands from CLAUDE.local.md "Project Scripts" table.

Run all test suites in parallel where possible, piping output to temp files for review:

```bash
# Run project's test commands from CLAUDE.local.md in parallel
# Example: project_test_cmd 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ship_tests.txt &
# Wait for all to complete
wait
```

After all complete, read the output files and check pass/fail.

**If any test fails:** Show the failures and **STOP**. Do not proceed.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — just note the counts briefly.

---

## Step 3.4: Test Coverage Audit

100% coverage is the goal — every untested path is a path where bugs hide and vibe coding becomes yolo coding. Evaluate what was ACTUALLY coded (from the diff), not what was planned.

**0. Before/after test count:**

```bash
# Count test files before any generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

Store this number for the PR body.

**1. Trace every codepath changed** using `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`:

Read every changed file. For each one, trace how data flows through the code — don't just list functions, actually follow the execution:

1. **Read the diff.** For each changed file, read the full file (not just the diff hunk) to understand context.
2. **Trace data flow.** Starting from each entry point (route handler, exported function, event listener, component render), follow the data through every branch:
   - Where does input come from? (request params, props, database, API call)
   - What transforms it? (validation, mapping, computation)
   - Where does it go? (database write, API response, rendered output, side effect)
   - What can go wrong at each step? (null/undefined, invalid input, network failure, empty collection)
3. **Diagram the execution.** For each changed file, draw an ASCII diagram showing:
   - Every function/method that was added or modified
   - Every conditional branch (if/else, switch, ternary, guard clause, early return)
   - Every error path (try/catch, rescue, error boundary, fallback)
   - Every call to another function (trace into it — does IT have untested branches?)
   - Every edge: what happens with null input? Empty array? Invalid type?

This is the critical step — you're building a map of every line of code that can execute differently based on input. Every branch in this diagram needs a test.

**2. Map user flows, interactions, and error states:**

Code coverage isn't enough — you need to cover how real users interact with the changed code. For each changed feature, think through:

- **User flows:** What sequence of actions does a user take that touches this code? Map the full journey (e.g., "user clicks 'Pay' → form validates → API call → success/failure screen"). Each step in the journey needs a test.
- **Interaction edge cases:** What happens when the user does something unexpected?
  - Double-click/rapid resubmit
  - Navigate away mid-operation (back button, close tab, click another link)
  - Submit with stale data (page sat open for 30 minutes, session expired)
  - Slow connection (API takes 10 seconds — what does the user see?)
  - Concurrent actions (two tabs, same form)
- **Error states the user can see:** For every error the code handles, what does the user actually experience?
  - Is there a clear error message or a silent failure?
  - Can the user recover (retry, go back, fix input) or are they stuck?
  - What happens with no network? With a 500 from the API? With invalid data from the server?
- **Empty/zero/boundary states:** What does the UI show with zero results? With 10,000 results? With a single character input? With maximum-length input?

Add these to your diagram alongside the code branches. A user flow with no test is just as much a gap as an untested if/else.

**3. Check each branch against existing tests:**

Go through your diagram branch by branch — both code paths AND user flows. For each one, search for a test that exercises it:
- Function `processPayment()` → look for `billing.test.ts`, `billing.spec.ts`, `test/billing_test.rb`
- An if/else → look for tests covering BOTH the true AND false path
- An error handler → look for a test that triggers that specific error condition
- A call to `helperFn()` that has its own branches → those branches need tests too
- A user flow → look for an integration or E2E test that walks through the journey
- An interaction edge case → look for a test that simulates the unexpected action

Quality scoring rubric:
- ★★★  Tests behavior with edge cases AND error paths
- ★★   Tests correct behavior, happy path only
- ★    Smoke test / existence check / trivial assertion (e.g., "it renders", "it doesn't throw")

**4. Output ASCII coverage diagram:**

Include BOTH code paths and user flows in the same diagram:

```
CODE PATH COVERAGE
===========================
[+] src/services/billing.ts
    │
    ├── processPayment()
    │   ├── [★★★ TESTED] Happy path + card declined + timeout — billing.test.ts:42
    │   ├── [GAP]         Network timeout — NO TEST
    │   └── [GAP]         Invalid currency — NO TEST
    │
    └── refundPayment()
        ├── [★★  TESTED] Full refund — billing.test.ts:89
        └── [★   TESTED] Partial refund (checks non-throw only) — billing.test.ts:101

USER FLOW COVERAGE
===========================
[+] Payment checkout flow
    │
    ├── [★★★ TESTED] Complete purchase — checkout.e2e.ts:15
    ├── [GAP]         Double-click submit — NO TEST

    └── [★   TESTED] Form validation errors (checks render only) — checkout.test.ts:40

[+] Error states
    │
    ├── [★★  TESTED] Card declined message — billing.test.ts:58
    ├── [GAP]         Network timeout UX (what does user see?) — NO TEST
    └── [GAP]         Empty cart submission — NO TEST

─────────────────────────────────
COVERAGE: 5/12 paths tested (42%)
  Code paths: 3/5 (60%)
  User flows: 2/7 (29%)
QUALITY:  ★★★: 2  ★★: 2  ★: 1
GAPS: 7 paths need tests
─────────────────────────────────
```

**Fast path:** All paths covered → "Step 3.4: All new code paths have test coverage ✓" Continue.

**5. Generate tests for uncovered paths:**

If test framework detected (or bootstrapped in Step 2.5):
- Prioritize error handlers and edge cases first (happy paths are more likely already tested)
- Read 2-3 existing test files to match conventions exactly
- Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis).
- Write tests that exercise the specific uncovered path with real assertions
- Run each test. Passes → commit as `test: coverage for {feature}`
- Fails → fix once. Still fails → revert, note gap in diagram.

Caps: 30 code paths max, 20 tests generated max (code + user flow combined), 2-min per-test exploration cap.

If no test framework AND user declined bootstrap → diagram only, no generation. Note: "Test generation skipped — no test framework configured."

**Diff is test-only changes:** Skip Step 3.4 entirely: "No new application code paths to audit."

**6. After-count and coverage summary:**

```bash
# Count test files after generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

For PR body: `Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)`
Coverage line: `Test Coverage Audit: N new code paths. M covered (X%). K tests generated, J committed.`

---


## Step 3.5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

1. Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`. If the file cannot be read, **STOP** and report the error.

2. Run `git diff origin/<base>` to get the full diff (scoped to feature changes against the freshly-fetched base branch).

3. Apply the review checklist in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** All remaining categories

4. **Classify each finding as AUTO-FIX or ASK** per the Fix-First Heuristic in
   checklist.md. Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational lean toward AUTO-FIX.

5. **Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items.** Apply each fix. Output one line per fix:
   `[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

6. **If ASK items remain,** present them in ONE AskUserQuestion:
   - List each with number, severity, problem, recommended fix
   - Per-item options: A) Fix  B) Skip
   - Overall RECOMMENDATION
   - If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual AskUserQuestion calls instead

7. **After all fixes (auto + user-approved):**
   - If ANY fixes were applied: commit fixed files by name (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit --no-verify -m "fix: pre-landing review fixes"`), then **STOP** and tell the user to run `/ship` again to re-test.
   - If no fixes applied (all ASK items skipped, or no issues found): continue to Step 4.

8. Output summary: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues — M auto-fixed, K asked (J fixed, L skipped)`

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

Save the review output — it goes into the PR body in Step 7.

---

## Step 5: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect` and help LLMs understand what changed.

1. Analyze the diff and group changes into logical commits. Each commit should represent **one coherent change** — not one file, but one logical unit.

2. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** schema changes, config changes, route additions
   - **Components & hooks:** new components, hooks, utilities (with their tests)
   - **Pages & routes:** pages, routes, layouts (with their tests)

3. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A component and its test file go in the same commit
   - A hook/utility and its test file go in the same commit
   - A page, its sub-components, and its test go in the same commit
   - Schema changes are their own commit (or grouped with the component they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

4. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

5. Compose each commit message:
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Body: brief description of what this commit contains
   - The **final commit** gets the co-author trailer:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: finalize feature

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

---

## Step 6: Push

Push to the remote with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Step 7: Create PR

Before creating the PR, check the project's CLAUDE.md for a PR template or additional PR instructions (look for sections mentioning "PR", "pull request", or "template"). If found, apply those instructions to the PR title, body, or flags. If `--repo` is specified in CLAUDE.md, use it.

Create a pull request using `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base> --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullet points summarizing the changes from the diff and commit history>

## Test Coverage
<coverage diagram from Step 3.4, or "All new code paths have test coverage.">
<If Step 3.4 ran: "Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)">

## Pre-Landing Review
<findings from Step 3.5, or "No issues found.">

## Test plan
- [x] All tests pass (N tests)

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

**Output the PR URL** — this should be the final output the user sees.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never skip tests.** If tests fail, stop.
- **Never skip the pre-landing review.** If checklist.md is unreadable, stop.
- **Never force push.** Use regular `git push` only.
- **Never ask for confirmation** except for pre-landing review ASK items (batched into at most one AskUserQuestion).
- **Split commits for bisectability** — each commit = one logical change.
- **Step 3.4 generates coverage tests.** They must pass before committing. Never commit failing tests.
- **The goal is: user says `/ship`, next thing they see is the review + PR URL.**
